# Moving Sofa Constant

## Description of constant

The moving sofa constant $A$ is the maximum area of a connected, rigid planar shape that can maneuver through an L-shaped corridor of unit width. 
The corridor is formed by two semi-infinite strips of width 1 meeting at a right angle. 
The problem asks for the shape of the largest area (the "sofa") that can be moved from one end of the corridor to the other by a continuous rigid motion (translation and rotation).

## Known upper bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $2 \sqrt{2}$ | [Hammersley1968] | Initial upper bound |
| 2.37 | [kallus2018] | The current best upper bound, proved using a computer-assisted proof scheme. |

## Known lower bounds

| Bound | Reference | Comments |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| $\pi/2 + 2/\pi$ | [Hammersley1968] | Initial lower bound |
| 2.2195 | [Gerver1992] | The current best lower bound |

## Additional comments

It was claimed in a recent preprint [baek2024] that Gerver's sofa [Gerver1992] is the optimal solution, which if true would solve the moving sofa problem.
