# Erdős minimum overlap constant

## Description of constant

$C_2$ is the largest constant for which one has
$$
 \sup_{x \in [-2,2]} \int_{-1}^1 f(t) g(x+t)\ dt\geq C_2
$$
for all non-negative $f,g: [-1,1] \to [0,1]$ with $f+g=1$ on $[-1,1]$ and $\int_\mathbb{R} f = 1$, where we extend $f,g$ by zero outside of $[-1,1]$.
